# GUESSING NUMBER GAME

![numbers](numbers.png)

In the guessing number game, one player thinks of a number and the other player tries to guess what that number is. The player who is guessing can ask for clues, like "higher" or "lower," to help them narrow down their guesses.

For example, let's say the number is between 1 and 10, and the player starts by guessing 5. If the number is higher than 5, the other player might say "higher," and the guessing player might then guess 8. If the number is lower than 8, the other player might say "lower," and the guessing player might then guess 6. This continues until the guessing player correctly guesses the number.
