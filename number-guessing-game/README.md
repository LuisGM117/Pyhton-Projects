# Number Guessing Game


This is a simple number guessing game made in Python.

## Description

The goal of the game is to guess a secret number randomly generated by the computer within a custom range. The player receives hints to know if their guess is too high or too low until they guess the correct number.

## Features
- The player chooses the lower and upper limits of the number range.
- The maximum number of attempts is automatically calculated using the binary formula:
  
	total_chances = ceil( log(upper - lower + 1) / log(2) )

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Choose the lower and upper limits of the range.
3. Try to guess the secret number within the allowed number of attempts.
4. The game will tell you if your guess is higher or lower than the secret number.
5. Keep trying until you guess the number or run out of attempts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running the Game
Open a terminal in the game folder and run:

```
