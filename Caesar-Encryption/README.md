# CAESAR ENCRYPTION PROGRAM 

## What's Caesar Encryption? ðŸ¤”

Caesar encryption is a simple and ancient method of encryption named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals. In Caesar encryption, each letter in a message is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

For example, if the shift is 3, then the letter A would be replaced by the letter D, B would become E, C would become F, and so on. The letter Z would wrap around and become C.

So, the plaintext "HELLO" with a shift of 3 would become "KHOOR" in the encrypted form. The Caesar encryption is a very simple encryption method and can be easily cracked by someone who knows the shift value.
