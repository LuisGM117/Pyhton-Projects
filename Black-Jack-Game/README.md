## What is BlackJack Game

 In Blackjack, you want to get a hand of cards that adds up to 21, or as close to 21 as possible without going over. Each card has a value, and you can ask for more cards to add to your hand until you decide to stop. The dealer also gets cards, and you want your hand to be better than the dealer's. If your hand is over 21, you lose. If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win!
