# Price Tracker

I just found an awesome concep called Web Scrapping.

Basically this gets an entire web page form url and check their components. This can help us to get the price for a product and use it to see if the price falls in the near future o whenever you need it.

## Dependencies

**Requests Module**

`pip install requests`

**bs4**

`pip install bs4`
